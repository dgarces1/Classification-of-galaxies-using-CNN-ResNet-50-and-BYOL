# Classification-of-galaxies-using-CNN-ResNet-50-and-BYOL
This repository contains implementations of a CNN, ResNet-50, and BYOL. The aim of this work is to compare these architectures in a galaxy classification problem using the galaxy10 dataset.

The work was developed in collaboration with **Nicoly Rodrigues, Thamara Medeiros, Inayê Melo** e **Eduardo Cherobin** 

The Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset contains images of galaxies divided into 10 classes.

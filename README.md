# Classification-of-galaxies-using-CNN-ResNet-50-and-BYOL
This repository contains implementations of a CNN, ResNet-50, and BYOL. The aim of this work is to compare these architectures in a galaxy classification problem using the Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset.

The work was developed in collaboration with **Nicoly Rodrigues, Thamara Medeiros, Inayê Melo** e **Eduardo Cherobin** 

The Galaxy10 DECaLS dataset contains images of galaxies divided into 10 classes.

The Galaxy10 DECaLS is quite unbalanced. Some classes has eight times more data than others, as shown in the following figure.

Several experiments were conducted with the architectures, and some of the results obtained were as follows:
